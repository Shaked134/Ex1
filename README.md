# Briefly explain
This project implements a solution for Ex1 in the Intro to Computer Science course. The goal is to develop a number converter and calculator that works with different bases (from 2 to 16).  
The project includes several functions to convert, calculate, and compare numbers in different formats and bases.


# Functions I made in the code
- Number Conversion: Converts numbers between bases (2 to 16) and decimal.
- Format Validation: Checks if a number string is valid.
- Base Calculator: Supports addition and multiplication of numbers in different bases.
- Find Maximum: Finds the largest number in an array of numbers.



## An explanation of the functions I did
- **`number2Int(String num)`**: Converts a formatted number into a decimal value.
- **`int2Number(int num, int base)`**: Converts a decimal number to a specific base.
- **`isNumber(String num)`**: Checks if a number string is valid.
- **`maxIndex(String[] arr)`**: Returns the index of the largest number in an array.
